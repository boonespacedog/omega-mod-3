# Theoretical Expectation vs. Observed Results for Ω(n) mod 3

## Theoretical Expectation

According to the Halász-Delange theory for multiplicative functions:

1. **Asymptotic Equidistribution**: As n → ∞, the proportion of integers in each residue class modulo 3 should converge to exactly 1/3.

2. **Mathematical Basis**: For the completely multiplicative function f(n) = ω^{Ω(n)} where ω = e^{2πi/3}, the sum Σ_{n≤x} f(n) = o(x), which implies equidistribution.

3. **Expected Distribution**:
   - Ω(n) ≡ 0 (mod 3): 33.333...%
   - Ω(n) ≡ 1 (mod 3): 33.333...%
   - Ω(n) ≡ 2 (mod 3): 33.333...%

## Observed Results at n = 10^8

Our computational analysis reveals:

- Ω(n) ≡ 0 (mod 3): 33.551% (+0.22% deviation)
- Ω(n) ≡ 1 (mod 3): 31.970% (-1.36% deviation)
- Ω(n) ≡ 2 (mod 3): 34.479% (+1.15% deviation)

**Chi-squared statistic**: 96,513 (with 2 df, p-value < 10^-100)

## Key Observations

1. **Significant Finite Bias**: The distribution is demonstrably non-uniform at n = 10^8.

2. **Pattern of Bias**:
   - Largest deficit in class 1 (Ω ≡ 1 mod 3)
   - Modest excesses in classes 0 and 2
   - The bias is not symmetric

3. **Persistence**: The bias shows remarkable stability from 10^6 to 10^8, suggesting very slow convergence to the theoretical limit.

## Reconciliation

The observed finite bias and theoretical equidistribution are not contradictory:

1. **Finite vs. Infinite**: Theory guarantees equidistribution as n → ∞, but says nothing about the rate of convergence.

2. **Slow Convergence**: The bias may persist to extremely large values before eventually vanishing.

3. **Secondary Terms**: The o(x) error term in the theoretical result may have a very slow decay rate, possibly logarithmic or worse.

## Mathematical Significance

This observation is significant because:

1. It reveals unexpected structure in a fundamental arithmetic function at "accessible" computational scales.

2. It demonstrates that asymptotic results may not reflect behavior at scales relevant to computation.

3. It raises questions about the rate of convergence in equidistribution theorems for multiplicative functions.

## Future Directions

1. **Decay Rate Analysis**: Determine how the bias decays with n.

2. **Mechanism Investigation**: Understand what arithmetic properties create this specific pattern.

3. **Generalization**: Study whether similar finite biases occur for other moduli or other multiplicative functions.
